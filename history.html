        <h2>How It All Began....</h2>
        <p>
            The Bistro Cafe first opened its doors in November of 
            1972! Bit and Byte Smith were new to Techieville and 
            discovered an empty building on the corner of 5th and 
            Hypertext Avenue. They always dreamed of opening up their 
            own restaurant. That dream came true in the Fall of 1972 
            when they purchased the building and began construction 
            on The Bistro Cafe. In November of 1972, they were ready 
            to open their doors. They decided to have a grand opening 
            on Thanksgiving Day and offered a free turkey dinner to 
            all who attended. This became a tradition that is still 
            being followed to this day. Every Thanksgiving Day, 
            The Bistro Cafe opens its doors and serves a free turkey 
            dinner.

            In 1994, Bit and Byte decided it was time to retire. They 
            turned over the reins of the Cafe to their son, Chip. Chip 
            continues to manage the Cafe today with the help of his wife, 
            Drive. Chip and Drive have added a few of their own special 
            recipes to the menu. But for the most part, the menu hasn't 
            change too much from the original one. The Bistro Cafe went 
            through a major remodel in 2002. A private party room was 
            added which can handle groups up to 40 people. If you would 
            like to plan a private party at The Bistro Cafe, please 
            contact Chip or Drive at the restaurant.
